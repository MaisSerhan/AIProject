## Step 1: Problem Understanding🤔

- **Task Nature**: The task is a regression problem where the target variable (PPV) is continuous. The objective is to create a model that accurately predicts PPV, minimizing prediction errors.

- **Outcome**: The goal is to train and evaluate a regression model, using performance metrics such as RMSE and MAE.
  

## Step 2: Data Understanding✍️

Data Understanding is a critical phase in any data science or machine learning project. It involves gaining insights into the dataset that will be used to train models. This phase focuses on understanding the structure, quality, and nuances of the data before performing any analysis or model building.

## 💁 input the dataset and convert it to a dataframe to:

### 1. Understand the Nature of the Data and Structure🧩
We will begin by loading the dataset into a dataframe and inspecting the first few rows to understand the overall structure. This includes checking the columns, their data types, and reviewing initial statistics to understand the general distribution.

### 2. Examine for Missing Data 🔍
To determine if any features contain missing or empty values that require imputation or removal. 

### 3. Examine Data Types 🏷️
Ensure that categorical features are correctly identified and coded. 

### 4. Descriptive Statistics 📊
We will calculate basic statistics such as:
- Mean
- Median
- Standard Deviation
- Min and Max

This will give us an understanding of the distribution and spread of the data, especially for numerical columns like age, duration, and PPV.

### 5. Detect Outliers 🚨 
We will examine numerical features for any extreme values that might distort predictions. Outliers can be detected using visualization techniques (e.g., box plots) or statistical methods (e.g., Z-scores).

### 6. Correlation Analysis 🔗
We will Measure the relationships between features and the target variable (PPV) to assess the fit of the features. 


## 💁‍♂️ Data Inspection Results

After loading the dataset and performing a thorough analysis, we obtained the following insights:

### 1. Dataset Columns:
- **Gender**: Categorical - Represents the gender of individuals.
- **Age**: Numeric - Represents the age of individuals.
- **Duration**: Numeric - Represents a duration-like value.
- **PPV**: Numeric - The target variable we aim to predict.

### 2. Missing Values:
- There are no missing values in the dataset. All columns are completely filled.

### 3. Data Types:
- **Gender**: Categorical (Object)
- **Age**: Numeric (int64)
- **Duration**: Numeric (int64)
- **PPV**: Numeric (float64) (Target Variable)

### 4. Descriptive Statistics:
- **Age**: Ranges from 0 to 80 years, with a mean of 31.3 years.
- **Duration**: Ranges from 1 to 50, with a mean of 22.88.
- **PPV (Target Variable)**: Ranges from 1.0 to 26.02, with a mean of 14.86.

### 5. Correlation Analysis:
- **PPV and Duration**: Strong positive correlation (**0.978**), indicating that Duration is a major predictor of PPV.
- **PPV and Age**: Moderate negative correlation (**-0.565**), indicating an inverse relationship.
- **Age and Duration**: Moderate negative correlation (**-0.507**), indicating some dependency between Age and Duration.

### Insights 🧑‍🏫:
- The dataset is clean, with no missing values or obvious issues.
- **Duration** (Dur) is highly correlated with **PPV**, making it the most significant predictor in the model.
- **Age** shows a moderately negative correlation with **PPV**, suggesting that it should still be included as a feature, despite the inverse relationship.

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing and Preparation⚙️

In this step, we will transform the dataset into a form suitable for training machine learning models:

1. **Encoding Categorical Features**:
   - The **Gender** column is categorical and needs to be converted into numerical values. We will use **label encoding** to convert `Male` to `0` and `Female` to `1`.

2. **Scaling Numerical Features**:
   - We will standardize the **Age** and **Duration** columns using **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler** to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

3. **Splitting Data**:
   - The dataset will be divided into **training** and **testing** sets (e.g., 80% for training, 20% for testing) to evaluate the model’s performance.

4. **Handling Outliers**:
   - Outliers in numerical features (**Age**, **Duration**, **PPV**) will be detected and handled using **winsorization** or **removal**, if necessary, to avoid skewing the model.

5. **Feature Selection**:
   - Based on the correlation analysis and domain knowledge, we will retain all available features (**Gender**, **Age**, **Duration**) for model training.

6. **Prepare for Modeling**:
   - Ensure the target variable (**PPV**) is separate and correctly aligned with the features for training.

 ⏳ Once the preprocessing steps are completed, we will display the prepared dataset.



## Step 4: Model Selection 💭

This step involves choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) to predict the target variable (**PPV**) based on the given features.

### 💁 Candidate Models:
Given that this is a regression task, we have identified the following machine learning models:

1. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**:
   - Known for its speed and performance on tabular data.
   - Handles missing values well and supports feature importance analysis.
   - **Justification**: Suitable for high-dimensional data and often achieves state-of-the-art results.

2. **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**:
   - Efficient for large datasets with many features.
   - Handles categorical data natively and offers faster training than XGBoost in many cases.
   - **Justification**: Can handle imbalanced and sparse data effectively.

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
   - Primarily used for image data but can be adapted for structured data.
   - **Justification**: Although CNNs may not be the most natural choice for this regression task, they could be explored for comparative purposes.

### 💁‍♂️ Selection Justification:
For this task, **XGBoost** is likely the best choice due to:
- Its ability to handle mixed data types (categorical and numeric).
- Robust performance on tabular datasets.
- Flexibility in fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.

### 💁‍♀️ Model Evaluation:
- We will evaluate the model's performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** on both the training and test datasets.
- Hyperparameter tuning will be performed (e.g., grid search or random search) to improve the model’s performance.

## Step 5: Model Training📈

This step involves training the selected model(s) on the preprocessed data and tuning it to achieve optimal performance.

### 1. **Training the XGBoost Model**:
   - We will train the **XGBoost** model using the preprocessed training dataset.
   - **Features**: Gender, Age, Duration
   - **Target**: PPV
   - Initially, we will train the model using default hyperparameters, followed by hyperparameter tuning if necessary.

### 2. **Steps to Train the Model**:
   1. **Import XGBoost**: Use the `XGBRegressor` from the XGBoost library.
   2. **Initialize the Model**: Set default hyperparameters (learning rate, max depth, number of estimators, etc.).
   3. **Train the Model**: Fit the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) to the model.
   4. **Evaluate Performance**: Validate the model on the test dataset (`X_test`, `y_test`) using RMSE and MAE.
   5. **Hyperparameter Tuning** (if needed): Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance.

### 3. **Expected Output**:
   - The output will include the **RMSE** and **MAE** values, which will assess the model’s predictive accuracy on the test dataset.

## Step 6: Model Comparison and Conclusion 📊✅  

In this step, we compare the performance of the model trained during the project. The comparison is based on key evaluation metrics, such as **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, to determine which model provides the most accurate predictions.

### 💁 Process of Comparison:

1. **Metric Analysis**:
   - Evaluate RMSE and MAE for each model.
   - Lower values for these metrics indicate better predictive performance.

2. **Model Insights**:
   - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each model based on their predictions.
   - Consider overfitting, underfitting, and computational efficiency.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Use comparison plots (e.g., bar charts or line graphs) to visually interpret the performance differences.

### 💁‍♂️ Conclusion:
Based on the comparison, we select the model that demonstrates the best balance between predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. The final selected model will be used for generating predictions and real-world implementation.
